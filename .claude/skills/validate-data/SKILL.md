# Validate loaded data

After a successful pipeline load, verify the schema and data make sense. Fix data types, nested structures, and missing columns as needed.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- `pipeline-name` (optional): the dlt pipeline name. If omitted, infer from session context. If ambiguous, ask the user and stop.
- `hints` (optional, after `--`): specific validation concerns

## 1. Inspect schema

### Export schema as mermaid

```
uv run dlthub local pipeline schema <pipeline_name> --format mermaid
```
Show the mermaid diagram to the user. This gives a quick overview of tables, columns, types, and relationships (parent/child).

## 2. View the data

### For the human: Workspace Dashboard

Tell the user to run Workspace Dashboard:
```
uv run dlthub local pipeline show <pipeline_name>
```
This opens a browser with table schemas, row counts, and sample data.

### For the agent: set up pipeline MCP server to query the data

You have mcp with a right set of tools available

## 3. Review with user

Ask the user if the schema and data look right. Common issues to address:

### Data type fixes

Use `processing_steps` in the resource config to transform data before loading. Available steps: `map`, `filter`, `yield_map`.

```python
"processing_steps": [
    {"map": lambda item: {**item, "amount": Decimal(item["amount"])}},
]
```

**IMPORTANT:** NEVER convert monetary amounts or precision-sensitive values to `float`. Always use `Decimal`.

### Nested structures

dlt auto-unnests nested arrays into child tables (e.g., `results` inside a response becomes `<resource>__results`). This is often fine for analytics. If the user wants a flat structure, use `yield_map` to flatten, or adjust `data_selector` to point deeper into the response.

### Missing columns

Columns that are all-null on first load won't have inferred types. Options:
- Add `columns` hints to the resource config: `"columns": {"field": {"data_type": "text"}}`
- Add `group_by` or other API params to populate the columns

## 4. Iterate

Re-run the pipeline after changes (`dev_mode` gives a fresh dataset each time). Use `debug-pipeline` to inspect traces and load packages after each run. Inspect again with MCP or `dlthub local pipeline schema <name> --format mermaid`. Repeat until the user is happy with the schema.

## Next steps

- **User is happy with data** → suggest `new-endpoint` for more resources, `view-data` for querying, or the `data-exploration` toolkit for interactive notebooks and reports
- **Need to fix pipeline code** → edit and re-run with `debug-pipeline`
- **User wants to see the data** -> Workspace Dashboard with command above
